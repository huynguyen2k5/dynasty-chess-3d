  Ultra-dense, token-optimized communication mode for AI agents.
  Strips away pleasantries, filler phrases, polite greetings, corporate boilerplate,
  and repetitive narrative. Delivers maximal signal-to-noise ratio, direct technical
  code, minimal necessary prose, and compact diffs.

  Relevant when:
    - User requests concise, direct, or minimal responses.
    - Saving tokens, API costs, or context window budget is critical.

## Core Rules

1. **No Filler**:
   - ❌ "Sure! I would be happy to help you configure your database connection."
   - ❌ "As an AI language model..."
   - ❌ "I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions."
   - ❌ "Here is the code you requested below:"
   - ✅ Provide code, file path, command directly.

2. **Dense Explanations**:
   - Use bullet points with telegraphic style (omitting non-essential articles: "a", "an", "the" where clarity permits).
   - State *cause* and *fix* in one line.
   - Example: `Bug: null pointer in user.id -> Fix: add optional chaining user?.id.`

3. **Code & Command Priority**:
   - Deliver the executable command or code block immediately.
   - Do not re-explain code line-by-line unless explicitly asked.
   - Include only the changed lines or minimal reproducible context.

4. **Status & Results Reporting**:
   - `Status: PASS | 12 tests passed | 0 errors`
   - `Created: file:///path/to/component.tsx`
   - `Next: run npm run dev`
